NO2 exposure and its health effect data sets.

## Summary

This repository was prepared for the final project of Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University, Spring 2020. It includes one folder with four data sets. The goal is to analyze the association between exposure to NO2 and the level of  urinary biomarkers 8-isoprostane


## Investigators
The investigator is Yang Wang, who is a master student at Duke University. The contact email is yangwangbluedevil@gmail.com. 

## Keywords

NO2, air pollutants, exposure to NO2, health effect, 8-isoprostane

## Database Information
All the data are from Jim Zhang's lab. Jim Zhang is a professor at the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
This data repository only includes one folder called "the data for the final project". This folder includes three raw data sets and they are all in the format of excel.csv files. The file 8-iso is the data set of urinary biomarker 8-isoprostane.  The file urine_info is the data set that has information about the subjects who provided the urine samples. The urine list is a data set with lists of information of sample ID, subject ID and visits.


## Metadata

## Quality assurance/quality control

The limit of detection for 8-isoprostane was 0.016ng/ml. Any value which is below 0.016 in the column of calculated Conc in 8-is data set should be excluded as an error.
