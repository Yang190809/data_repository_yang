**Abstract**

Mounting evidence shows that exposure to NO2 generates oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can cause lipid damage, which plays an important role in various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Urinary 8-isoprostane is a product of lipid peroxidation which can reflect systemic lipid damage. I built linear mix models to analyze the relationship between the level of urinary 8-isoprostane with the level of NO2 exposure. I found that short term NO2 exposure was associated with lipid peroxidation, reflected by increased concentrations of urinary 8-isoprostane associated with increasing exposure. One IQR (7.41 µg/m3) incremental change of 12-h NO2 exposure was associated with an increase of 8-isoprostane level by 19.45% (95% Cl: 14.37%, 24.55%, p-value <0.001). One IQR (8.64 µg/m3) incremental change of 24-h NO2 exposure was associated an increase in 8-isoprostane level by 27.69% (95% Cl: 20.50%, 34.95% ,  p-value <0.001). One IQR (4.47 µg/m3) incremental change of 1-week NO2 exposure was associated with an increase in 8-isoprostane level by 25.15% (95% Cl: 14.14%,36.31%, p-value <0.05). One IQR (2.74 µg/m3) incremental change of 2-week NO2 exposure was associated with an increase in 8-isoprostane level by 15.68% (95% Cl: 8.87%,22.65%, p-value <0.05).

# Rationale and Research Questions
Exposure to NO2 associated with cardiovascular disease, lung function impairment and asthma (Mölter, A., et. al.,2013, Collart, P., et. al.,2018, Takenoue, Y., et. al., 2012 ). Mounting evidence shows that exposure to NO2 generates oxidative stress (Hashemzadeh, B., et. al.,2019). Oxidative stress can cause lipid damage (Black, C. N., et. al., 2017), which plays an important role in various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. (Zanolin, M. E., et. a.,2015, Lakshmi, S. V., et. al., 2009). I applied 8-isoprostane to investigate the health effects of short term NO2 exposure.


8-isoprostane is the product of the oxidized cell membrane after being attacked by reactive oxygen species such as peroxides. Therefore, 8-isoprostane can reflect lipid damage (Danielsen et al., 2009). 8-isoprostane in urine does not have a diurnal variation and has been proven to be a stable biomarker showing systemic lipid damage. It has been applied in studying diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, coronary heart disease, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Nuernberg, A. M., et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the use of this biomarker in the research of air pollution and its health effects is scarce. One study in Iran discovered a significant positive relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in healthy children aged 12-13 years old (Hashemzadeh, B., et. al., 2019). One study in New York City found that the increases in 1- to 5-day averages of nitrogen dioxide were significantly associated with increases in 8-isoprostane in EBC among 18-year old healthy and asthma affected individuals (Patel, M. M., et. al., 2013).
My research question is:  If the NO2 exposure is positively associated with urinary 8-isoprostane?
Among periods of 12-hour,24-hour,1-week and 2-weeks, which period has the most significant association with urinary 8-isoprostane?


# Dataset Information

All the data are obtained from Jim Zhang's lab. The urine samples were collected from participants of a previously described study conducted in Changsha, China by Dr. Zhang and other researchers ( Day, D. B., et. al.,2018). The study recruited 89 healthy individuals (age>18years old) who were living and working at the Broad Company Campus and divided them into 2 groups, Group A (n = 36) and Group B (n = 53). The study periods include pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention, lasting 5 weeks. Urine samples were collected from each participant once during the pre-intervention, twice during the intervention, and once during the post-intervention. The study measured hourly indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2, surveyed each participant’s time-activity, and calculated the participants’ exposure for each pollutant over 12h, 24h, 1 week and 2 week periods, which were counted backward from the visit points.

The file 8-iso is the data set of urinary biomarker 8-isoprostane. The file urine_info is the data set that has information about the subjects who provided the urine samples. The urine list is a data set with lists of information of sample ID, subject ID and visits. The meaning of the columns as well as units and class of the data in each foler is listed below. Column names without descriptors are irrelevant to this study.

## Urine list raw data set
The urine list has the information about the sample ID, subject ID and visits.

Column Name	| Meaning	                            |units |	  class of the data
------------|-------------------------------------|----- |---------------------
 Sample ID	|   the identity number of the samples	  |NA	 |      integer
Subject ID |	 the identity number of the subjects	|NA	    |   integer
 visit	  |   the number of the 4 visits (1,2,3 or 4)	|NA	  |     integer
\center __Table 1__ \center 

## 8-isoprostane data set
The 8-isoprostane data set has information about 8-isoprostane concentration tested in the mass spectrum and the concentration of 8-isoprostane in original urine samples. The limit of detection for 8-isoprostane was 0.016ng/ml. Any value which is below 0.016 in the column of calculated Conc in 8-is data set should be excluded as an error.

Column Name	|    Meaning                                   |    Units	  |    Class of the data
------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------

 Calculated Conc|	the concentration tested by the machine   |   ng/ml	 |   numeric
Sample Conc	 |   the concentration in the original urine|	     ng/ml	  |  numeric
\center __Table 2__ \center 

## Urine Info	
The urine info is the data set that has information about subjects characteristics and average pollutant exposure (NO2, SO2, O3, and PM2.5)over the periods of 12 hours, 24 hours, one week, and two weeks. It also includes average temperature and humidity over the periods of 12 hours, 24 hours, one week, and two weeks.

## Data Wrangling

My data wrangling started with loading the data set of 8-isoprostane and changing the column names. Then I merged this data set with the urine list to match the sample ID with subjects ID and visit. Then this merged data was merged with the urine info data set using the subject ID and visit as the matching keys. After the second merging, the rows with NAs were removed. Then I calculated the normalized 8-isoprostane using the specific urine gravity. This normalization can adjust the dilution in the urine. I obtained my final data by selecting columns that are relevant to my research question. Finally, the processed data was saved into a processed data folder.

# Exploratory Analysis 
The Shapiro tests showed that concentrations of urinary 8-isoprostane are not normalized (p-value < 2.2e-16). The Shapiro tests showed that concentrations of log-scale urinary 8-isoprostane are still not normalized (p-value < 2.2e-16). To build linear models, I need to use the more normalized log-transformed concentrations of urinary 8-isoprostane. The distribution of data in log(8-isoprostane) (Figure 2)looks more normalized than the distribution of data of 8-isoprostane in (Figure 1).

```

# Analysis
I used linear mixed models with participant-specific intercepts. The inclusion of participants as a variable in mixed-effects models account for the correlation of repeated measurements from the same individuals and precludes the need to control for participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, BMI, the identity of smoker or non-smoker) that do not change across the four longitudinal measurements.

I used NO2 exposure as predicting variables and log-transformed urinary biomarkers as dependent variables. For each biomarker, I built 4 models to the exposure over the periods of 12h, 24h, one week, and two weeks. I used a backward stepwise model selection method to select the co-variables for each model. The co-variables that I tested in the models were last meal, the start of the workday, respiratory infection status, menstruation, and the time of second-hand exposure. I also tested the SO2 exposure, ozone exposure and PM2.5 exposure, the average temperature and humidity during a corresponding period. 


With the stepAIC function, the best models were chosen with the lowest AIC. The vif tests show that there is no model with excess intercorrelation in the predicting variables. Figure 3 shows that all four diagnostic plots have the shape of a triangle. The higher the fitted value is, the higher the residue is. This residue is a result of skewed distribution of log scaled of the predicting variable .In general, the residue distribution is not bad. No value is bigger than an absolute value of 2.5.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,include=FALSE}
p1<-plot(mo1.1)
p2<-plot(mo2.1)
p3<-plot(mo3.1)
p4<-plot(mo1.1)
```

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,p4, nrow = 2, align = 'h')
```
Both 12-hour, 24-hour, 1-week and 2-week NO2 exposure showed significant correlations with the level of urinary 8-isoprostane, especially the 2-week NO2 exposure.
